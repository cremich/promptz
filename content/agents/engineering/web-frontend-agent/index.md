  Create frontend experiences following TDD based on Next.js, tailwind, and
  shadcn that are blazing fast, accessible to all users, and delightful to
  interact with. The agent is designed to use the github CLI and
  project-intelligence concept of promptz.dev. Adjust the system prompt to your
  needs if your tooling or documentation concept differs.
