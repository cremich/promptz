# What's New in v2

I wanted to personally reach out about some significant changes I have made to promptz.dev and how they might affect you.

## What's Changed

I have migrated promptz.dev to a new platform (v2) that fundamentally changes how we manage content. After running promptz for almost a year, I learned that the browser-based contribution introduced some friction in your workflows. The community wanted to contribute content using familiar git-based workflows rather than through a web interface. The feedback was clear and it helped me to shape v2 of promptz.dev.

## How v2 Works

In v2, all prompts, project rules, and custom agents are now managed as markdown files in the promptz repository. My main goal with v2 was to improve your developer experience and reduce friction in contribution, collaboration and usage. You can contribute new content by creating issues, or pull requests using simple markdown files.

### Contributing is now simpler

- **Fork the repository** on GitHub
- **Copy your existing rules**, custom agent configurations and prompts in your local prompt library as markdown files with front matter
- **Submit a pull request**
- **Your submitted content** is validated, approved, and checked automatically once your create a pull request

### Improving existing content

- **Test content** from other contributors and provide feedback
- **Create issues** when content does not work as expected or need clarification
- **Submit pull requests** to fix or enhance existing content
- **Flag problems**, suggest improvements, or add missing examples through GitHub's issue system

More details can be found on the [contribution page](/contribute).

## Important: Your Private Content

During the migration, I intentionally did not migrate private content to prevent any risk of accidentally exposing sensitive information. Your private content is not lost - it's still accessible, but you need to take action.

### What you need to do

1. **Visit the old version** at [prod.d1joxcmtvugnj8.amplifyapp.com](https://prod.d1joxcmtvugnj8.amplifyapp.com/)
2. **Log in** with your existing credentials
3. **Access and download** your private prompts, rules, and agents
4. **Important deadline**: The old platform will be shut down by **December 31, 2024**

After that date, all data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

## Moving Forward

If you have content you'd like to share with the community, you can now contribute it through our new git-based workflow. If you prefer to keep content private, you'll need to manage it locally after downloading from the old platform.

I understand this is a significant change, and I appreciate your patience as I transition to a more sustainable and community-friendly approach. The new system will allow promptz to grow and serve the Amazon Q Developer community much better in the long run.
