# Generate CDK & Lambda code from Drawio diagram

/dev can you generate application from the drawio diagram (I want the code of the lambdas to be written in python and the infrastructure as code with the python cdk v2)

## How to Use

Your working folder should contain one drawio diagram containing the design of your app (for example an s3 bucket that triggers a lambda function)
