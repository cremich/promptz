# Generate Draw.io architecture diagram from code

@workspace generate a draw.io diagram in an xml format of this application.
I want to use AWS 2024 Icons, lines should be orthogonal, dataflow from up to bottom

## How to Use

You need a folder containing your application code (python, typescript, ...) and your Infrastructure as Code templates (e.g. SAM template).
Copy/Paste the generated code into a app.drawio file, preview your markdown file (e.g. using Draw.io Integration extension in VS Code)
