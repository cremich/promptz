# Generate CDK & Lambda code from Mermaid diagram

/dev generate application files from this mermaid diagram.
I want the code of the lambdas to be written in python and the infrastructure as code to be written with the python cdk v2
{{ Mermaid diagram as code }}

## How to Use

The working folder (i.e your workspace) should be empty for a better result.

TIP: you can generate a mermaid diagram of a sample application using 'Mermaid application diagram', 'Mermaid class diagram' or 'Mermaid sequence diagram' on promptz.dev and copy paste what is generated in the {{ Mermaid diagram as code }} place holder
