- Demographics: [Age, gender, occupation, location, etc.]
- Goals: [What are their primary objectives when using the product?]
- Motivations: [What drives them? What are their needs and desires?]
- Pain Points: [What challenges or frustrations do they face?]
- Activities: [What are their typical daily activities and routines?]
- Notable Quotes: [What are some things they might say related to the product?]
