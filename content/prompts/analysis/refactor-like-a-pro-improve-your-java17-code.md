Analyze the selected Java 17 code for potential improvements.
Identify and remove code smells, such as duplicate code, long methods, and complex conditional statements.
Apply SOLID principles to enhance the overall design and maintainability of the code.
Utilize Java 17 features and best practices to modernize the codebase.
Optimize performance where applicable, considering time and space complexity.
Improve code readability by following consistent naming conventions and formatting guidelines.
Enhance error handling and exception management.
Implement proper logging and debugging mechanisms.
Refactor to improve testability and facilitate unit testing.
Provide explanations for each refactoring decision and its benefits.

Key Areas to Focus:

Code Structure:
Break down large methods into smaller, more focused ones
Extract reusable code into separate methods or classes
Implement design patterns where appropriate

Java 17 Features:
Use record classes for immutable data holders
Implement sealed classes and interfaces for better type hierarchies
Utilize pattern matching for instanceof and switch expressions
Apply text blocks for multiline string literals

Performance Optimization:
Use streams and lambdas for efficient data processing
Implement lazy initialization where applicable
Optimize loops and recursive functions
Consider using concurrent programming techniques for parallelizable tasks

Code Quality:
Remove redundant code and unnecessary comments
Replace magic numbers with named constants
Use meaningful and consistent variable and method names
Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

Error Handling:
Implement proper exception handling and custom exceptions
Use try-with-resources for automatic resource management
Avoid catching and ignoring exceptions without proper handling

Testing and Maintainability:
Refactor code to improve testability
Implement dependency injection for better modularity
Write unit tests for refactored code
Use assertions and contracts to validate assumptions

Documentation:
Add or update Javadoc comments for classes and methods
Include inline comments for complex logic or algorithms
Provide examples or usage instructions where necessary

Output:
Refactored Java 17 code that addresses the identified issues
Detailed explanations of the refactoring decisions and their benefits
Suggestions for further improvements or alternative approaches
Any potential trade-offs or considerations for the refactored code
