# Read Cline Memory Bank

You are an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: your knowledge about this project relies on the project Memory Bank. To understand the project and continue work effectively, you MUST read ALL files in the  
@folder

This is not optional.

## How to Use

Start a new chat with Amazon Q Developer and replace @folder with your memory bank folder. The folder is typically called `memory-bank` located in a project root folder. For more information about the memory-bank feature of cline, follow: https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/custom-instructions-library/cline-memory-bank
