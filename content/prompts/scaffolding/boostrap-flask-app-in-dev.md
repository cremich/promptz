# Boostrap Flask App in /dev

1. Create a folder in your project workspace (I call mine "project", the name might be significant, I have not tried others)
2. In this folder, create a file called "project-standards.md"
3. Add the following markdown into this file

```
When creating new Python code, use the following guidance

- Generate code using the following structure and layout

├── static/
├── models/
├── routes/
├── templates/
├  app.py
```

4. Save the file, and then you are good to go

## How to Use

With this file in your project workspace, code generated by /dev will adopt these norms.
