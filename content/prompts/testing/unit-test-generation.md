# Unit test generation

Please review this code, and write out a list of missing test cases, and code tests that should exist. The list will be given to a developer, so they should be in a format that is compatible with gitlab issues. and write them down to test.md

## How to Use

This can be executed from the CLI or from the chat window, you can instruct Amazon Q Developer CLI to write them directly to test.md by adding: "and write them down to test.md"
You can run this commands multiple times and will create more unit tests, I also recommend adding this to your @prompts.
