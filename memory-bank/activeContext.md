# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus appears to be on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, as indicated by the open file `app/mcp/page.tsx`. MCP allows AI models to access external tools and resources, enhancing their capabilities.

## Recent Changes

Based on the project structure and open files, recent work likely includes:

1. Implementation of the MCP page and functionality
2. Development of landing page benefits components
3. Updates to prompt actions and functionality

## Active Components

The following components are currently being worked on:

- **MCP Integration**: `app/mcp/page.tsx`
- **Landing Page Benefits**:
  - `app/ui/landing-page/benefits-card.tsx`
  - `app/ui/landing-page/benefits.tsx`
- **Prompt Actions**: `app/lib/actions/prompts.ts`

## Current State

The application appears to be in active development with core functionality implemented:

- User authentication via AWS Cognito
- Prompt creation, editing, and browsing
- Favoriting/starring functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- MCP integration (in progress)

## Next Steps

Based on the current focus, potential next steps might include:

1. **Complete MCP Integration**:

   - Finalize the MCP page implementation
   - Test MCP functionality with various tools
   - Document MCP usage for users

2. **Enhance User Experience**:

   - Refine landing page benefits presentation
   - Improve prompt discovery features
   - Optimize mobile experience

3. **Expand Functionality**:
   - Add more prompt templates or categories
   - Implement additional social features
   - Enhance analytics for prompt usage

## Active Decisions

Key decisions that may be under consideration:

1. **MCP Implementation Approach**:

   - How to present MCP capabilities to users
   - Which MCP tools to prioritize
   - Security considerations for MCP integration

2. **User Experience Refinements**:

   - How to best showcase benefits on the landing page
   - Optimizing the prompt creation workflow
   - Improving search and discovery

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Performance optimizations
   - Scalability planning
   - Testing strategy for new features

## Open Questions

- How will MCP integration enhance the prompt platform specifically?
- What metrics will be used to measure the success of new features?
- Are there any upcoming changes to the data model or API?
- What user feedback has been received on existing features?

## Dependencies and Blockers

- AWS Amplify configuration and permissions
- MCP server availability and compatibility
- Any API rate limits or constraints
- Testing environment setup for new features
