# Active Context: Promptz

## Current Focus

The project is currently in the initial development phase, focusing on establishing the core functionality and infrastructure for the Promptz platform. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Core Platform Setup**: Establishing the Next.js application with AWS Amplify backend
2. **Authentication System**: Implementing user authentication with Amazon Cognito
3. **Prompt Management**: Creating the basic CRUD operations for prompts
4. **UI Components**: Developing reusable UI components for the application

## Recent Developments

- Set up the project structure with Next.js App Router
- Configured AWS Amplify Gen 2 backend with authentication and data resources
- Implemented basic UI components using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives
- Created authentication flows (signup, login, password reset)
- Developed initial prompt display and management components

## Current Challenges

1. **Authentication Flow**: Ensuring a seamless authentication experience with proper error handling
2. **Data Modeling**: Refining the prompt data model to support all required use cases
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient data fetching and rendering
4. **Testing Coverage**: Expanding test coverage for critical components

## Decision Points

### Authentication Strategy

- **Decision**: Use Amazon Cognito for authentication with custom UI components
- **Rationale**: Provides seamless integration with AWS services while allowing for customized user experience
- **Alternatives Considered**: Auth0, Firebase Authentication, custom JWT implementation

### Data Storage

- **Decision**: Use DynamoDB for storing prompt data
- **Rationale**: Scalable, serverless database that integrates well with AppSync and Amplify
- **Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL with RDS

### UI Framework

- **Decision**: Custom components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives
- **Rationale**: Maximum flexibility and control over design while maintaining accessibility
- **Alternatives Considered**: Material UI, Chakra UI, AWS Cloudscape

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Sprint)

1. Complete authentication flow with proper error handling
2. Implement prompt creation and editing functionality
3. Develop prompt discovery features (search, filtering)
4. Enhance test coverage for critical components

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)

1. Implement tagging and categorization system
2. Add user profiles and author attribution
3. Develop community features (ratings, comments)
4. Optimize performance and user experience

### Long-term

1. Implement analytics to track prompt usage and effectiveness
2. Develop recommendation system for prompts
3. Add integration capabilities with IDE plugins
4. Explore AI-assisted prompt improvement features

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle prompt versioning and iteration?
2. What metrics should we track to measure prompt effectiveness?
3. How can we encourage community contributions and quality content?
4. What moderation systems will be needed as the platform scales?

## Current Environment

- Development is primarily focused on the sandbox environment
- Testing is performed locally and through automated test suites
- No production deployment has been made yet

## Team Focus

- Frontend development: Building out the UI components and user flows
- Backend development: Configuring AWS services and implementing data access patterns
- DevOps: Setting up deployment pipelines and environment configurations
- Testing: Implementing comprehensive test coverage
