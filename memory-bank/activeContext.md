# Active Context: Promptz

## Current Focus

The project is currently in the initial development phase with a strong focus on enhancing the prompt management functionality. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Prompt Management**: Refining CRUD operations and improving the user experience for prompt creation, editing, and sharing
2. **Draft System**: Implementing and refining the draft system for prompts
3. **UI Components**: Enhancing prompt-related UI components for better usability
4. **Core Platform Setup**: Continuing to establish the Next.js application with AWS Amplify backend
5. **Authentication System**: Refining user authentication with Amazon Cognito

## Recent Developments

- Enhanced prompt management functionality with improved form components
- Implemented draft system for saving work-in-progress prompts
- Added prompt deletion functionality with confirmation dialog
- Implemented tagging system with categorization by SDLC activity, interface, and category
- Refined prompt editing interface and workflows
- Continued development of prompt display and management components
- Improved data models and server actions for prompt operations

## Current Challenges

1. **Prompt Management UX**: Creating an intuitive and efficient interface for prompt creation and editing
2. **Data Modeling**: Continuing to refine the prompt data model to support all required use cases
3. **Code Migration**: Updating legacy code to use the new component structure and server actions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient data fetching and rendering for prompt operations
5. **Testing Coverage**: Expanding test coverage for prompt-related components
6. **Authentication Flow**: Addressing edge cases in authentication experience with proper error handling

## Decision Points

### Authentication Strategy

- **Decision**: Use Amazon Cognito for authentication with custom UI components
- **Rationale**: Provides seamless integration with AWS services while allowing for customized user experience
- **Alternatives Considered**: Auth0, Firebase Authentication, custom JWT implementation

### Data Storage

- **Decision**: Use DynamoDB for storing prompt data
- **Rationale**: Scalable, serverless database that integrates well with AppSync and Amplify
- **Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL with RDS

### UI Framework

- **Decision**: Custom components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives
- **Rationale**: Maximum flexibility and control over design while maintaining accessibility
- **Alternatives Considered**: Material UI, Chakra UI, AWS Cloudscape

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Sprint)

1. Complete prompt editing functionality with improved validation
2. Implement advanced prompt creation features
3. Develop prompt discovery features (search, filtering)
4. Enhance test coverage for prompt-related components
5. Address authentication edge cases and error handling

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)

1. Implement tagging and categorization system
2. Add user profiles and author attribution
3. Develop community features (ratings, comments)
4. Optimize performance and user experience

### Long-term

1. Implement analytics to track prompt usage and effectiveness
2. Develop recommendation system for prompts
3. Add integration capabilities with IDE plugins
4. Explore AI-assisted prompt improvement features

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle prompt versioning and iteration?
2. What metrics should we track to measure prompt effectiveness?
3. How can we encourage community contributions and quality content?
4. What moderation systems will be needed as the platform scales?

## Current Environment

- Development is primarily focused on the sandbox environment
- Testing is performed locally and through automated test suites
- No production deployment has been made yet

## Team Focus

- Frontend development: Building out the UI components and user flows
- Backend development: Configuring AWS services and implementing data access patterns
- DevOps: Setting up deployment pipelines and environment configurations
- Testing: Implementing comprehensive test coverage
