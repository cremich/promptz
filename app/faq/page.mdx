Welcome to the Promptz FAQ! Find answers to common questions about contributing, installation, and using AI development resources across Kiro CLI and IDE environments.

<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">

<AccordionItem value="contributing">
<AccordionTrigger>How do I contribute to promptz?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Contributing to Promptz is straightforward! We accept raw Kiro files from your `.kiro` folders - the same files you use locally with Kiro IDE and CLI.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Fork the [promptz.lib repository](https://github.com/cremich/promptz.lib)
2. Copy files from your `~/.kiro/` or `<project>/.kiro/` folders
3. Place in appropriate directories: `steering/`, `prompts/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `powers/`
4. Remove sensitive data and use kebab-case naming
5. Create a pull request with a clear description

For detailed contribution guidelines, visit our [Contribute page](/contribute).

<AccordionItem value="what-to-contribute">
<AccordionTrigger>What should I contribute?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Focus on resources that solve common development challenges:
- **Steering documents** that define useful coding standards
- **Prompts** for frequent development tasks
- **Custom agents** for specialized CLI workflows
- **Agent hooks** for IDE automation
- **Kiro powers** for complete tool packages

**Consider broad applicability:**
- Will other developers find this useful?
- Does it solve a common problem?
- Is it generic enough to work in different projects?

<AccordionItem value="prepare-files">
<AccordionTrigger>How do I prepare my files for contribution?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Before contributing:
- Remove sensitive information (API keys, personal data, absolute paths)
- Test configurations in a clean Kiro environment
- Use kebab-case naming for all files
- Verify correct file extensions (`.kiro.hook` for hooks)

<AccordionItem value="feature-compatibility">
<AccordionTrigger>What features can I use in CLI vs IDE?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Different content types work in different environments. Here's the compatibility matrix:

#### Universal Content (CLI + IDE)
<ModalityBadge support="both" />

Works in both Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE environments:

- **Steering Documents** - Development standards and coding guidelines
- **Prompts** - Reusable AI instructions for development tasks

*Note: CLI supports local managed prompt libraries*

#### CLI-Only Content
<ModalityBadge support="cli" />

Specialized for command-line workflows:

- **Custom Agents** - AI assistants configured for terminal-based development

#### IDE-Only Content
<ModalityBadge support="ide" />

Designed for the integrated development environment:

- **Agent Hooks** - Event-driven automation from promptz.lib library
- **Kiro Powers** - Complete tool packages with specialized knowledge

#### Different Implementations
- **Hooks** have different implementations in CLI vs IDE environments

**Why don't all features work everywhere?**

Each environment has different capabilities:
- **CLI** excels at terminal-based workflows and custom agent configurations
- **IDE** provides rich integration with file system events and visual interfaces
- **Both** support core AI assistance through prompts and steering documents

</AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem value="installation">
<AccordionTrigger>How do I install prompts/steering/agents/powers/hooks?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

**Simple Answer:** Copy any content from promptz libraries directly into your `.kiro/` folders. That's it!

#### Installation Steps
1. **Download or copy** content files from promptz libraries
2. **Place them** in the appropriate `.kiro/` directory:
   - **Global** (all projects): `~/.kiro/steering/`, `~/.kiro/prompts/`, `~/.kiro/agents/`, `~/.kiro/hooks/`, `~/.kiro/powers/`
   - **Project-specific**: `<project>/.kiro/steering/`, `<project>/.kiro/prompts/`, `<project>/.kiro/agents/`, `<project>/.kiro/hooks/`, `<project>/.kiro/powers/`
3. **Restart** Kiro CLI or reload IDE to pick up new content

#### Important Notes
- **Same installation method** works for both Kiro CLI and IDE
- **Content compatibility** varies by environment (see compatibility matrix above)
- **File structure** should match the original library organization
- **Remove sensitive data** before copying (API keys, personal paths, etc.)

For environment-specific usage instructions, refer to the [official Kiro documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/).

<AccordionItem value="file-placement">
<AccordionTrigger>Where do I put the files after downloading?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

File placement depends on scope:

**Global Configuration** (`~/.kiro/`):
- `steering/` - User-wide development standards
- `prompts/` - Personal AI instruction templates
- `agents/` - Custom CLI agents

**Project-Specific** (`<project>/.kiro/`):
- `steering/` - Project-specific standards
- `hooks/` - Project automation (IDE)
- `agents/` - Domain-specific agents

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem value="content-types">
<AccordionTrigger>What are the different content types available?</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent>

Promptz hosts five main types of AI development resources:

#### Prompts
<ModalityBadge support="both" />

AI instructions for specific development tasks like code generation, testing, documentation, and architecture. These work in both CLI and IDE environments.

**Examples:**
- Automated code review instructions
- Git commit message generation
- Unit test generation prompts
- Security analysis guidelines

#### Steering Documents
<ModalityBadge support="both" />

Configuration files that ensure AI assistants consistently follow established patterns, libraries, and standards across your projects.

**Examples:**
- Git conventions and workflows
- TypeScript coding standards
- Testing guidelines
- Framework-specific best practices

#### Custom Agents
<ModalityBadge support="cli" />

Specialized AI assistants configured for specific workflows and development processes in CLI environments.

**Examples:**
- AWS operations agent
- Kanban workflow agent
- Web frontend specialist
- System intelligence agent

#### Agent Hooks
<ModalityBadge support="ide" />

Automation tools that execute predefined agent actions when specific IDE events occur, like file saves or commits.

**Examples:**
- Auto-format on save
- Run tests on commit
- Session initialization workflows
- Code quality checks

#### Kiro Powers
<ModalityBadge support="ide" />

Packaged tools, workflows, and best practices that Kiro can activate on-demand, providing specialized knowledge and capabilities.

**Examples:**
- Stripe integration tools
- AWS infrastructure as code
- Terraform management
- API testing suites
